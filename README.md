# Clustering-Electrofacies
A clustering script for python using well log data to classify rock types.

## The Results

The code takes the assigned well data and generates classifications. This can be used to identify regions of high porosity and therefore the highest production.

The image below shows the classification displayed on a 3D plot where the user can select the data and it will be be displayed on the depth plot showing where the points are found in the well.
